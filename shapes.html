    I am passionate about drawing because it is really fun to draw shapes, objects and emotions/feelings. 
    In school, I always doodle on the side of pages in notebooks or worksheets, it always spices up a boring paper.

<p>I was introduced to it in elementary, and kept on doodling.

    I got my inspiration from Amanda Rach Lee, I started watching her journaling videos beginning High School. 

    Amanda Rach Lee continues to inspire me and I have gotten better at doodling similar or 
    different shapes plus it helps me to stay focused on the job at hand.
