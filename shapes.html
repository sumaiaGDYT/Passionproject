My passion is drawing/doodling 
It helps me to destress and refresh my mind. Truth be told I do get lost in it sometimes but the result is amazing and I concentrate on my work better than when I started it off at the beginning.
I watched a lot of youtube videos, mostly bullet journaling.
Amanda Rach Lee was an inspiration to me in the beginning because I watched a lot of her videos on bullet journaling and I do not journal much but doodling and coloring helps all the time. 
Amanda Rach Lee is still my inspiration because the themes that she does in her bullet journal are different and has meaning behind them. Watching her videos are also another way I relax my mind.
